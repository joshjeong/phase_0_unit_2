# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# 2. Pseudocode

# def method essay_writer
# pass several arguments: title, person, place, topic, date, thesis
# create a template and use interpolation to call argument


# 3. Initial Solution
def essay_writer(title, person, place, topic, date, thesis)
  print "\t #{title}: The life of #{person} can be described as impactful. #{topic} was changed forever and a legend was created. Unfortunately, #{person}'s life was cut short on #{date} in #{place}. #{thesis}" 
end
essay_writer("Father of Rap: 2Pac","Tupac Shakur", "Las Vegas","Hip Hop","1996","He changed an era with his lyrics and actions altering the course of the industry.")
