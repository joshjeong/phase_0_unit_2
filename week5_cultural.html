		<h2>Tech up</h2>
			<p>The tech industry is a beast of its own. It rapidly changes and grows as people demand more and more from their devices. Computers and phones are constantly getting replaced my a smaller one as if they were a Matryoshka doll. With an industry this volatile, how does one find stability? </p>

			<p>I used to work in a memory division at a tech company and Moore's law seemed to be an unspoken presence at every meeting. The law states that, "the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every 18 months". In layman's terms- specifications such as memory and speed double in capacity every 18 months. The upkeep and pressure to constantly keep up with the market was more than half the race.</p>

			<p>In addition to to hardware, the coding language is also evolving. New languages are released that learn from the current existing ones- altering features to enhance it. Although this may seem daunting, the foundation is mostly the same with only a few changes to syntax and some words jumbled around. As a future programmer, I must always be up to date with technology and take every day as a learning experience.</p>
