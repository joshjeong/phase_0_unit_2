		<h2>You Mad Bro??</h2>
			<p>Finally the day had come, I was moving to college. Different emotions arise as I carry my boxes to my cell they called a room. I didn't know what to expect. Our room was originally for one person but because of the number of students that year, it was converted into a triple. I was about to get very acquainted with two strangers. Are they clean freaks? Have weird habits? Do they snore? Questions that would all be  answered soon.</p>
			<p>I walked in and met my first roommate- a quiet guy with glasses. We made small talk as we unpacked and anticipated our third roommate- we’ll call him Mufasa. When Mufasa finally arrived, he was extremely friendly and all three of us got along just dandy.</p>
			<p>As the days progressed, we all got comfortable, some a little too comfortable. One day I opened my closet and saw clothes that were not mine. Mufasa walked in and said he had no more space in his and thought I wouldn’t mind. It bugged me a little, but he was right- I didn’t mind too much. I left for class and came back to see if anyone else was hungry. I again walk in for a surprise. I see Mufasa wearing my clothes getting ready to go on a date. He said he didn’t have anything nice so he was just going to borrow my shirt. I guess roommates are supposed to share things? I would’ve preferred to be asked first, but I let it go. This happened with everything… My food, laptop, bed, toiletries, you name it. I eventually cracked and lost it. We got into an argument and I basically had verbal diarrhea of all the instances I felt like he was taking advantage. He was very taken back. We ended up going out to eat and to talk things through. It was a long overdue conversation that ended up going extremely well. Mufasa and I became really good friends that still talk to this day.</p>
			<p>Through this experience, I learned not to be passive aggressive. If there is an issue, calmly confront it before it becomes an unnecessarily bigger issue. I don’t think I would go back and change what I did because I learned a lot from it and we both like to look back and laugh at it.</p>
